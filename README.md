# Linear Regression from Scratch 🔢

Build, train, and evaluate a linear regression model **without using scikit-learn**. Includes support for multiple features, batch gradient descent, regularization, and a UI to interact with predictions.

---

## 💡 Features

- From-scratch implementation (no ML libraries)
- Multivariate & univariate regression
- Gradient Descent + Normal Equation
- Custom evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, R²)
- Streamlit web UI & CLI support
- EDA & Visualizations
- Ridge/Lasso regularization
- Modular structure with unit tests

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Streamlit (for web app)
- Pytest (for testing)

---

## 📁 Structure

- `src/`: Core model, metrics, helpers
- `data/`: Input dataset(s)
- `notebooks/`: EDA and prototyping
- `tests/`: Unit test cases
- `app.py`: Run UI or CLI
